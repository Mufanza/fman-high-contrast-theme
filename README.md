A light, high-contrast theme for [fman](https://fman.io/).
Made to look and feel good when working with E-Ink monitors (such as [Dasung Paperlike](http://www.dasungtech.com/))

## Install option 1 (recommended)

Install [FmanAlternativeColors plugin](https://github.com/strayge/FmanAlternativeColors)

This theme already comes bundled with it.

## Install Option 2: 

Download this repo, then manually place (or replace) these two files in your fman installation:

**styles.qss** goes in _C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Local\fman\Versions\your_version_

**theme.css** goes in _C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Local\fman\Versions\your_version\Plugins\Core_

If fman is updated, you will need to (re)place these files again ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
